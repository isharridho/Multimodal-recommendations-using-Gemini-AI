### Objectives

Your main objective is to learn how to create a recommendation system that can provide both recommendations and explanations using a multimodal model: Gemini 1.5 Pro.

In this notebook, you will begin with a scene (e.g. a living room) and use the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to perform visual understanding. You will also investigate how the Gemini Pro model can be used to recommend an item (e.g. a chair) from a list of furniture items as input.

By going through this notebook, you will learn:
- how to use the Gemini Pro model to perform visual understanding
- how to take multimodality into consideration in prompting for the Gemini Pro model
- how the Gemini Pro model can be used to create retail recommendation applications out-of-the-box
